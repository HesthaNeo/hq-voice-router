    <h2><strong><u>Implementation</u></strong></h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Rack, Mount, and Power On The Cisco 2911 Router</h3>
            <p>- First, we'll Add a 2901 Router to the topology by dragging and dropping it into the Headquarters section of the lab. We'll place the 2911 Router in the right side area of HQ and label it as “HQ-WAN-RTR”.</p>
                <img width="1178" height="1001" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 141321" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6363b3b-3940-4fda-a02f-ffe1e280f30f" />
        <h3>Step 2: Basic Switch Configurations (Hostname, NTP, Domain-Name, SSH, Etc)</h3>
            <p>- In this step, we did basic configuration for both of the switches including changing their hostnames, setting their time zones, enabling SSH, setting domain names, adding securiting to console and vty lines for SSH, and creating user profiles with a password the devices</p>
                <img width="871" height="980" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 141447" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1ef04ae-0ddc-40c7-9f86-1b93f42bd98c" />
        <h3>Step 3: Install uck9 License</h3>
            <p>- Next we will activate the security licensing 60 day grace period on the 2901 Router. We do this to unlock advanced security features, primarily for setting up VPNs (IPsec), secure communication, and enhanced firewall functionality.</p>
                <img width="2559" height="824" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 141925" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e9b69d6-8d99-4f79-9fc6-761765e184b4" />
                <img width="2559" height="1267" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 142031" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50124ebc-70df-4843-98bc-678e2e20c2f1" />
                <img width="2559" height="1597" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 142112" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/698d3e75-98f8-48ed-932f-6bdf07910127" />
            <p><em>- After reloading the router, you can see that the securityk9 licensing software was installed successfully.</em></p>
        <h3>Step 4: Configure and Connect HQ LAN Interface G0/0</h3>
            <p>- Next we will configure and connect the LAN facing interface G0/0.</p>
                <img width="872" height="650" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 142613" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b7dbc3f-e745-47f7-9efc-b3b2187799dd" />
            <p><em>- Both MGMT and DATA VLAN interfaces were configured here as well.</em></p>
            <p>- Next, using a straight-through cable, we'll connect the LAN interface G0/0 to a trunk port on HQ-CORE-SW2 (i.e. FastEthernet0/20) and verify the port comes online.</p>
                <img width="1175" height="1033" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 143240" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccbd187c-d7c2-4623-9521-4f684993ebca" />
                <img width="874" height="276" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 144551" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4acf6e07-0d13-4d12-a860-b2090fd1e128" />
        <h3>Step 5: Configure Default Route Pointing Back to HQ Core Voice Network HSRP Address</h3>
            <p>- Next we will configure and connect the private WAN interface.</p>
                <img width="874" height="403" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 144842" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aefbee72-12bc-4b84-9ac0-a6b825611801" />
            <p><em>- Using the "speed 100" command, we effectively set our speed to 100Mbps matching the ISP router interface. Command "bandwidth 50000" sets the bandwidth reference in kilobits (=50Mbps). We also want to ensure no cdp messages are sent to the provider network, so we execute "no cdp enable" command.</em></p>
            <p>- Next, using an ethernet cross-over cable, we'll connect the private WAN interface G0/1 to the PRIVATE WAN CLOUD router interface FastEthernet0/0.</p>
                <img width="1183" height="973" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 145302" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcffc9ed-34cd-4547-801e-b1d8086b47c5" />
                <img width="868" height="433" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 145438" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d17e92b-7753-44a4-8b2d-1650654cec1f" />
            <p><em>- As you can see, we are able to successfully ping the private WAN cloud router.</em></p>       
        <h3>Step 6: Configure HQ Voice Network DHCP Services</h3>
            <p>- Next we will configure the BGP router ID and set up peering with the provider router.</p>
                <img width="871" height="244" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 180121" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbeda697-9903-4118-9b78-93b1b48dd3e2" />
            <p><em>- Command "router bgp 65123" enters the BGP configuration for autonomous system #65123. The "bgp router-id" command will force the router to use g0/1 IP as the BGP ID. The command "neighbor 192.168.250.1 remote-as 65535" effectively configures BGP peering.</em></p>
            <p>- Next we will configure the following network statements to advertise across the Private WAN.</p>
                <img width="870" height="462" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 151942" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f65b0a0f-dd72-4117-baf6-c436f371babb" />
            <p>- Break down of all network statements:</p>
            <p><em>- network 192.168.110.0 mask 255.255.255.0 <b>(Advertises HQ MGMT)</b></em></p>
            <p><em>- network 192.168.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0 <b>(Advertises HQ DATA)</b></em></p>
            <p><em>- network 10.10.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0 <b>(Advertises HQ VOICE)</b></em></p>
            <p><em>- network 192.168.130.0 255.255.255.0 <b>(Advertises B2 MGMT)</b></em></p>
            <p><em>- network 192.168.30.0 mask 255.255.255.0 <b>(Advertises B2 DATA)</b></em></p>
            <p><em>- network 10.10.30.0 mask 255.255.255.0 <b>(Advertises B2 VOICE)</b></em></p>
            <p><em>- Our BGP verification config:</em></p>
                <img width="2559" height="1599" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 152526" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cb578e0-d2ea-48e1-913e-bc8fbc011de0" />
        <h3>Step 7: Configure Telephony-Service</h3>
        <h3>Step 8: Configure HQ and Branch 2 Ephone-DNS</h3>
            <p>- Next, we will set up VPN policy and crypto map for IPSec site-to-site VPN to Branch 2.</p>
                <p>- A: We will start by configuring ISAMKP policy.</p>
                <img width="868" height="307" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 153207" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe071df0-5fd0-4b8c-8d84-12711020c600" />
            <p><em>- We use the command "crypto isakmp policy 10" to tell the router to create a new, prioritized set of security rules (a "policy") for negotiating a VPN connection. "crypto isakmp" tells the router to manage the security of a VPN connection, "policy" starts a configuration block to define how the routers will identify each other and secure their initial conversation, and "10" is the priority number.</em></p>
            <p><em>- "encr aes" is telling the router to use the AES algorithm to encrypt data.</em></p>
            <p><em>- "authentication pre-share" is telling the router to use a "secret handshake" to verify who it is talking to. It ensures that only devices knowing the exact same "shared secret" (password) can establish a secure connection, and by entering the command "group 2", we are telling the devices to which mathematical "strength" to use when creating their encryption keys. Group 2 is "1024-bit" strenght. Not the strongest, but for this lap purpose we will be using this.</em></p>
                <p>- B: Next, we will configure IPSec SA lifetime and transform set.</p>
                <img width="868" height="272" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 155001" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/285847a2-04fc-4473-9244-66de40762f1d" />
            <p><em>- The command "crypto ipsec security-association lifetime seconds 86400" will configure the router to set the Phase 2 IPsec Security Association (SA) lifetime to 86,400 seconds, which is 24 hours. This means the IPsec tunnel will automatically re-key (refresh its encryption keys) every 24 hours to enhance security.</em></p>
            <p><em>- The command "crypto ipsec transform-set BRANCH-2 esp-aes esp-sha-hmac" creates a security policy named "BRANCH-2" that encrypts traffic using AES and verifies data integrity using SHA-HMAC [1, 3]. "crypto ipsec transform-set" essentially defines a transform set, which is a named combination of security protocols and algorithms that protect data in an IPsec VPN tunnel. "BRANCH-2" is the name of this specific transform set. "esp-aes" specifies that Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) will be used for encryption to ensure data confidentiality using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. "esp-sha-hmac" specifies that ESP will be used for authentication to ensure data integrity using the SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) HMAC.</em></p>
                <p>- C: Next, we will create an Access Control List that matches any traffic going to Branch 2 networks.</p>
                <p><em>- This ACL will be used in the crypto map configuration.</em></p>
                <img width="869" height="339" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 160339" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcfd8194-f405-4856-99e1-05ab3f0924a4" />
                <p>- D: Next, we will create the crypto map that will be applied to the VPN-ONLY Internet ineterface.</p>
                <img width="872" height="697" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 160914" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38a4b88c-48a5-4d60-a070-cd63dfdba3c7" />
            <p><em>- The command starts the configuration of the rule that tells the router to secure traffic to branch 2 office using automatic encryption (IPsec) and automatic key management (ISAKMP). It essentially prepares the router to build an automatic, dynamic IPsec VPN tunnel for traffic going to the branch 2 office. </em></p>
             <p><em>- "crypto map BRANCH-2-MAP" essentially names the policy set "BRANCH-2-MAP". This is a container for all the rules defining the VPN to a specific location.</em></p>
             <p><em>- "100" sets a priority number (sequence number) for this specific rule within the map. If there are multiple rules, lower numbers are checked first.</em></p>
             <p><em>- "ipsec-isakmp" Specifies that this rule will use IKE (Internet Key Exchange/ISAKMP) to automatically negotiate security keys and IPsec to encrypt the data packets.</em></p>
             <p><em>- "set pfs group2" enables Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) which will force the routers to generate a brand-new, independent key for every single session. Normally, a VPN uses one "master" key (from Phase 1) to help create the keys that actually encrypt your data. If someone were to steal that master key, they could theoretically decrypt all our past and future traffic. This an extra insurance policy. Again "group2" is the encryption strength algorithim. </em></p>
             <p><em>- We use "set security-association lifetime seconds 86400" to set an expiration date for the VPN’s encryption keys. In this case, it is 24 hours. Once that time is up, the routers will throw them away and negotiate brand-new ones.</em></p>
             <p><em>- "set transform-set BRANCH-2" specifies we will be using the rule set we create for the crypto map titled "BRANCH-2".</em></p>
             <p><em>- With the command "match address BRANCH-2-TRAFFIC" we essentially telling the router to identify and group specific network traffic that matches the rules defined in our access list named "BRANCH-2-TRAFFIC".</em></p>
                 <img width="870" height="397" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 182833" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4443d94-462e-4a75-ad76-50f057039e25" />
             <p><em>- Our currenty crypto map configuration.</em></p>
        <h3>Step 9: Configure PSTN Access-List</h3>
            <p>- For this step, we will configure an Access Control List that only allows traffic from the Branch 2 IPSec VPN tunnel.</p>
                 <img width="869" height="327" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 183232" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e774fb4-53e8-4e2c-9648-653f806caf53" />
             <p><em>- "permit udp host 50.50.50.50 any eq isakmp" is essentially allowing traffic using the udp protocol to host 50.50.50.50 from any of our internal devices using the VPN that are specifically using the UDP port 500, which is the standard port for negotiating VPN security keys.</em></p>
             <p><em>- "permit udp host 50.50.50.50 any eq non500-isakmp" is allowing traffic using the udp protocol to host 50.50.50.50 from any of our internal devices using the VPN that are specifically using the UDP port non500-isakmp, which is a keyword for UDP port 4500. When a VPN connection needs to pass through a router that translates IP addresses (NAT), standard VPN traffic (usually port 500) can get blocked or broken. To fix this, the devices "float" the traffic to UDP port 4500, which acts as a tunnel for the encrypted data to pass through the NAT device safely</em></p>
             <p><em>- "permit ahp host 50.50.50.50 any" essentially is telling the firewall/router to allow VPN traffic coming from the specific IP address 50.50.50.50 to go anywhere. "ahp" is for Authentication Header Protocol. This is a specific type of IPsec security protocol used to verify that data has not been tampered with</em></p>
             <p><em>- We use "permit esp host 50.50.50.50 any" to ensure that the IPsec VPN tunnel can be established and pass data without being blocked by security policies. We apply this on the outside interface of the firewall/router.</em></p>
        <h3>Step 10: Configure PSTN Voice Interface G0/1</h3>
            <p>- For this step, we will configure and connect the VPN-ONLY internet connection for the site-to-site VPN to Branch 2.</p>
                <p>- A: We will start by configuring the internet connection.</p>
                 <img width="871" height="619" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 185635" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1280d3fb-9d30-470b-b3ce-e4fd040fd778" />
             <p><em>- We use command "ip access-group VPN-ONLY in" to restrict access to only the Branch 2 VPN.</em></p>
             <p><em>- We use command "crypto map BRANCH-2-MAP" to apply the crypto map for encrypting traffic.</em></p>
                <p>- B: Lastly, we will connect the interface to the Internet Provider router and test connectivity. Using an ethernet cross-over cable, we'll connect the VPN-ONLY Internet interface G0/2 to the INTERNET CLOUD router interface FastEthernet1/0.</p>
                 <img width="1181" height="988" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 190254" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a32858d-c770-423f-83eb-7560f70867ed" />
                 <img width="872" height="433" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 190949" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cf5e2a5-2f20-4a62-bb5d-1f6526240eb5" />
             <p><em>- We use command "no ip access-group VPN-ONLY in" to temporarily allow test pings back in. As you can we were able to successfully connect to the ISP router. We do command "ip access-group VPN-ONLY in" to reapply the access list allowing only VPN and save our current configuration.</em></p>            
        <h3>Step 11: Configure Internal Dial-Peers</h3>
            <p>- For this last step, we will add static routes for the default route, VPN endpoint, Branch 2 traffic, and HQ voice network.</p>
                <img width="869" height="1033" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-08 191526" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fba025e-2601-4078-985f-c88867f9acf5" />
            <p>- Break down of all  our current static routes.</p>
            <p><em>- ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.10.253 <b>(Default Route to HQ-INET-RTR)</b></em></p>
            <p><em>- ip route 50.50.50.50 255.255.255.255 218.105.21.21 <b>(VPN endpoint to ISP Gateway)</b></em></p>
            <p><em>- ip route 192.168.130.0 255.255.255.0 50.50.50.50 <b>(Branch 2 to VPN endpoint)</b></em></p>
            <p><em>- ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 50.50.50.50 <b>(Branch 2 to VPN endpoint)</b></em></p>
            <p><em>- ip route 10.10.30.0 255.255.255.0 50.50.50.50 <b>(Branch 2 to VPN endpoint)</b></em></p>
            <p><em>- ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.100 <b>(HQ VOICE to HQ Core Switch)</b></em></p>
        <h3>Step 12: Configure Internal Dial-Peers</h3>
